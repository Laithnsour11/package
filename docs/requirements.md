# Knowledge Base System Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the requirements for a comprehensive knowledge base system with front-end capabilities for data input and a back-end for data processing, storage, retrieval, and API access.

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to upload various file types to the knowledge base so that I can store and later retrieve information from these files.
2. As a user, I want to input text directly into the knowledge base so that I can add information without creating separate files.
3. As a user, I want to record videos directly through the interface so that I can capture and store visual information.
4. As a user, I want to search the knowledge base using natural language queries so that I can find relevant information quickly.
5. As a user, I want to access the knowledge base programmatically through an API so that I can integrate it with other systems.
6. As a user, I want the system to understand the context and relationships between different pieces of information so that search results are relevant and comprehensive.

## Front-End Requirements

### File Upload
- Support for multiple file formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV, etc.)
- Drag-and-drop interface
- Progress indicators for uploads
- File size limitations and validation
- Preview capability for uploaded files

### Text Input
- Rich text editor for direct text input
- Auto-save functionality
- Formatting options
- Tagging and categorization

### Video Recording
- In-browser video recording capability
- Basic editing features (trim, crop)
- Automatic transcription of recorded videos
- Thumbnail generation

### Search Interface
- Natural language search box
- Filters for content type, date, tags, etc.
- Results display with relevance scoring
- Preview of matched content

## Back-End Requirements

### Data Processing
- Text extraction from various file formats
- Video transcription
- Content chunking for optimal vectorization
- Metadata extraction and storage

### Vectorization
- Conversion of text and transcribed content to vector embeddings
- Support for multiple embedding models
- Efficient storage and indexing of vectors
- Periodic reindexing capability

### RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)
- Context-aware retrieval of relevant information
- Semantic search capabilities
- Relevance ranking
- Support for hybrid search (keyword + semantic)

### Storage
- Vector database for embeddings
- Document/file storage
- Metadata database
- User session management

### API Endpoint
- RESTful API for knowledge base access
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting
- Comprehensive documentation
- Support for various query parameters
- Structured response format

## Technical Requirements

### Performance
- Fast response times for queries (<2 seconds)
- Support for concurrent users
- Efficient handling of large files
- Scalable architecture

### Security
- Secure file handling
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities
- Data encryption

### Integration
- Well-documented API
- Webhook support for notifications
- Export capabilities

## Technology Stack

### Front-End
- React.js for UI components
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Media recording APIs for video capture
- File handling libraries

### Back-End
- Flask for the web framework
- Vector database (e.g., FAISS, Chroma, or Pinecone)
- Embedding models (e.g., sentence-transformers)
- SQLite or PostgreSQL for metadata storage
- Redis for caching (optional)

## Constraints
- Must be deployable as a standalone application
- Must support modern browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Must be responsive for mobile and desktop use
- Must handle files up to 50MB in size
